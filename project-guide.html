		<h1>Project Guide</h1>
	</div>


	<h4>So you have an idea for a project, could be a software, could be a video-game, a website, or even a mobile app. The only problem is that you don't know where to start.<br> So, here's a definitive step-by-step guide on how to bring your project ideas to life (as a beginner).</h4>

	<h4 style="color:var(--sec);">The guide assumes that you already know the basics of your language ( which you can do from <a style="display:inline; color:var(--sec);" href="index.html#languages">here</a> )</h4>



	<section style="margin-left:50px;">

		<h2 id="step1">1) Have clear Expectations.</h2>
		<h3>Write down what you expect your program will be able to do, in order for it to function as expected.</h3>
		<h3>For-example</h3>
		<div class="example">
			<h4>Let's assume that you're making a To-Do list app with C++.<br> The above program is expected to:</h4>
			<ul style="margin-left:50px;">
				<li><h4 style="margin:0px; padding:0;">Draw stuff on a window.</h4></li>
				<li><h4 style="margin:0px; padding:0;">Create new notes and save them.</h4></li>
				<li><h4 style="margin:0px; padding:0;">load previously saved notes and display them.</h4></li>
				<li><h4 style="margin:0px; padding:0;">update and save old notes.</h4></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		

		 <hr style="margin-top:100px;">
		<h2>2) Research for Libraries(If needed)</h2>

		<h3>Now go through your list<span style="color:var(--sec);">(from <a style="display:inline; color:var(--sec);" href="#step1">Step 1</a>)</span> and one-by-one check if your language can natively perform that task. If it can't, google which module/library can do so.</h3>

		<h3>For-example</h3>
		<div class="example">

			<h4>For the prior example list<span style="color:var(--sec);">(from <a style="display:inline; color:var(--sec);" href="#step1">Step 1</a>)</span> Creating, Saving and Loading notes (as a file) can be done with native C++.</h4><h4> But Drawing stuff in a window requires a library.<br> Search "C++ GUI Library" on Google, the easiest sources for finding stuff like this is StackOverflow & Reddit. ( Do not use Quora for coding related things)</h4><h4> Once you've found the library you were looking for, write it's name down.</h4>

		</div>



		 <hr style="margin-top:100px;">
		<h2>3) How to learn a Library.</h2>

		<h3>If you need to learn a new library, Search on YouTube Or StackOverflow to understand the basics, If you need more help, google stuff along the way.</h3>
		<h4>You don't need to know everything, rather just enough to get the job done. <br> While reading documentation of a library is a good practice <span style="color:var(--sec);">(if you want to know everything it has to offer)</span>, it's not completely necessary to do so.</h4>
	


		 <hr style="margin-top:100px;">
		<h2>4) Write Sudo-Code to make the process easier</h2>

		<h3>Now that you've understood all the tools you'll need for your project. It's time to write some sudo-code.</h3>
		<h3>Although it's not compulsory, writing sudo-code does help immensely when you're starting out as a beginner.</h3>


		 <hr style="margin-top:100px;">
		<h2>5) Implement the sudo-code into your project.</h2>

		<h3>Don't write large chunks of code at once, even if you know exactly what you're doing.<br>Write sudo-code for 1 task and implement only that 1 task in your code at a time, don't rush things.</h3>
		<h3>And if something breaks, comment out a single line of code, run the program, if the problem persists, un-comment that line and try a different one, google your errors if you need to.</h3>

		<h1>Pro Tips</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">If a bunch of lines work together to perform a task, make it a Function.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">Each Function should exist to only do 1 thing, and not multiple.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">Your syntax should have sufficient indentation, 1-Tab for every Function, Class, Loop, and If Statement.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">The Name of your Variables, Functions, and Classes should be self-explanatory.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">If your code is getting too long(>200 lines), try dividing it into multiple files if you can.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">Prompts given to the user for input should be clear and to the point.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">Consider every single invalid value while taking Inputs from the user.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">Never look at answers for coding questions on Quora.</h4></li>
			<li><h4 style="padding:0;">Memorizing Syntax doesn't make you a better programmer, your problem-solving skills do.</h4></li>
		</ol>

		<h4 style="padding:0;">Programming is a process that takes time and effort, a CS project can take anywhere between a Day and a Year, sometimes even longer.<br> Most if not all Large Open-Source projects started out as a personal endeavor. So be patient, keep coding, and never abandon your projects.</h4>
